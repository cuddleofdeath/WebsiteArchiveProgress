Note: I, CuddleofDeath, do not claim to have written this code. I have simply compiled it from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design (beta) course. I have completed the portion of the course to build this neat city skyline.

However, I wanted to upload it to Github to archive it and so that I could reference it later on whenever I start creating my own pages/apps.

I hope that this archive also helps others learn, or hope that it provides supplemental material at the least!
