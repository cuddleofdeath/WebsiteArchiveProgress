Note: I, cuddleofdeath, do not take credit for the code written for the Accessible Form Project.
The code comes from completion of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Website Design (beta). It exists in this repository simply
as supplemental learning material.

This is the completed form, but again, I do not take credit for the code! I am simply compiling/uploading it so that I, or
someone else who stumbles across this repo can maybe use it for learning as well!
