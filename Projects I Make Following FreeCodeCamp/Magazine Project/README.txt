Note: I, CuddleofDeath, do not claim to have written the code in this portion of the repository. 

I simply followed freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design (Beta) course. This is the fully-compiled code after finishing the exercise. 

It is meant to be used for educational purposes to help me retain information. Or, perhaps, it could be useful for others who are trying to learn (or reference) code as guides.
