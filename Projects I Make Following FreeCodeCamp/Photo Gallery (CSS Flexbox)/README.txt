This code is not code that I take credit for. It is the completed code for freecodecamp's "Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery" lesson.
The lesson is inside the beta version of the Responsive Web Design curriculum.

I am merely compiling it in this repo for reference for whenever I start building other things,
or if the compiled reference could help someone else create/learn something - awesome!
