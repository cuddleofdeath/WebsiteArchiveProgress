Note: This "Picasso Style Painting" is made up of compiled html/CSS from freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design (beta) course. I, CuddleofDeath, do not claim any of the compiled code as my own. It is simply being used and archived for learning purposes.

Feel free to look at the code and use it to learn stuff yourself, if you find it to be something helpful :)
