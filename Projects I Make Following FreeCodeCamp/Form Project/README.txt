This project is something that I, Kristen/CuddleofDeath, created after
completing both the Responsive Web Design course (minus projects), plus
partial completion of the new Responsive Web Design course (this is the first project
that they ask you to complete on this one, so I wanted to start here!)

All code that will be written in the Form Project section of the repo will be from
what I have learned. If you see any mistakes or issues, feel free to put in a PR. 
I will use PRs to learn! Thank you. 

As such, if anyone wants to fork this for a reference to a web form, feel free to do so.
