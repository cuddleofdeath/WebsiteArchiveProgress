Note: The code in this part of the repo (Balance Sheet - Pseudo Selector Exercise) is not something that I, cuddleofdeath, take credit for writing.

This part of the repo simply compiles the completed project from freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design (beta) course.

The particular section that this will be compiling is the Balance Sheet section.

As such, this code is something that is meant to be used as a learning tool to reference back later as I start building sites/apps.

Feel free to also read over it for learning purposes as well!
