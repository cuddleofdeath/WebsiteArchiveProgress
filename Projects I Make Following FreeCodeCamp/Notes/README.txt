This portion of the repo simply just contains notes that I'm taking
as I'm learning more things. The notes will be in a seperate
notes.txt file. Some of them may have more specific names.

There may also be an index.html where I make a webpage full of little
notes and stuff that I learn while going down the path of being
a front-end dev.
