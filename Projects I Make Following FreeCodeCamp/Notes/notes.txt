I plan on making these notes onto a little webpage later to showcase
skills that I learn. For now, however, I will simply just compile
a list of notes here. 

They may not be organized or anything yet.

                                                CSS Tips:
1. If an element is overlapping another element, use the overflow: hidden; option within the element in question.

Things I learned:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.

Things I need to look up:
1. What is an em? I know what a rem is, but what is em?
2. what does the 'clear' property really do? How does it work?
