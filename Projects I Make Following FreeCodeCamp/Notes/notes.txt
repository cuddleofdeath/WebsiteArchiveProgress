I plan on making these notes onto a little webpage later to showcase
skills that I learn. For now, however, I will simply just compile
a list of notes here. 

They may not be organized or anything yet.

                                                CSS Tips:
1. If an element is overlapping another element, use the overflow: hidden; option within the element in question.
