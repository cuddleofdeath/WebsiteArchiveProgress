I plan on making these notes onto a little webpage later to showcase
skills that I learn. For now, however, I will simply just compile
a list of notes here. 

They may not be organized or anything yet.

                                                CSS Tips:
1. If an element is overlapping another element, use the overflow: hidden; option within the element in question.

Things I learned:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.

Another thing I learned:
- Whenever setting the aspect-ratio in CSS, you can set something, like....16:9 [1080p], by simply using:
aspect-ratio: 16/9;
(This seemed pretty obvious, but it's also something I may easily forget, so I figured writing it down would be a great idea :))

You can target specific elements nested within other elements by writing code like this:
elementName > nestedElement {
  
}

Then you can insert whatever css formatting you'd like.

For example, if you had unordered list elements nested within the nav element, you could use
this code to evenly space the children (ul [the list] - in this case.)

nav > ul {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}


                                    Things I need to look up:
1. What is an em? I know what a rem is, but what is em?
2. what does the 'clear' property really do? How does it work?
3. Learn more about the vw measuring unit.


                                      HTML Things that I learned:
1. When creating a link to a form, the proper way to go about it looks something like this:
<form method="post" action="https://randomlinkthatmayormaynotgosomewheredontclickit/please/formsubmit">
<section>Section test</section>
<section>Section test 2</section>
<section>Section test 3</section>
</form>
