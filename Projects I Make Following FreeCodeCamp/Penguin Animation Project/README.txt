I, CuddleofDeath, do not claim to have written this code. I am simply compiling it after going through freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design (beta) course. 

This section is from the "Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin" part of the course.

I have completed it, and I am simply compiling the code here in this repository for educational purpose.

It may be used as a reference in future projects, or it can potentially help others who wish to reference it, perhaps to learn HTML/CSS, or to brush up on it.
