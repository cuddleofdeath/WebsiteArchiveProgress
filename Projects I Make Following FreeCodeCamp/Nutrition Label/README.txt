The following code is the complete, compiled code after completing 
freeCodeCamp's "Build a Nutrition Label" portion of their new learning curriculum
for the Responsive Web Design (beta) build.

As such, I, CuddleofDeath, do not take any credit for the following code.
I hope that this can be used as archived content to help someone else learn.
I also plan on reviewing this archived project to continue to reference and learn from it.

As always, any particular code that I do write by myself, I will always include that information
in each project folder's README.txt.
