The code for "Low Highlight Text Effect" is code from the "Low Highlight Text Effect CSS | Quick CSS Tutorial"
on YouTube from Coding Artist.

This repo, from CuddleofDeath, simply compiles the code to be used for learning purposes. I, CuddleofDeath, do not take credit writing any of the code for this effect.

I intend on using this code in potential future projects, but wanted to leave it here for learning purposes.
